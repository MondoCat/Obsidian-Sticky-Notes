# Obsidian-Sticky-Notes
This is a fork of the Daily-Notes-Reminder by btderr02.

I wanted a sticky notes app on the desktop that linked to Obsidian, and his plugin used the daily notes with a requirement of the date in the file name. I kind of hate daily notes, I dont know what day it is! I want a to do list that goes for weeks, months, and years before I get to the thing, lol!

So here you go if anyone wants it :) It was a simple edit. Thank you @JaySeeJC for helping with this! <3
